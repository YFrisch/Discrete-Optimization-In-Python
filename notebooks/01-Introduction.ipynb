    "        \\displaystyle \\text{max} & c^\\top x &\\\\\n",
    "        \\displaystyle \\text{s.t} & Ax \\le b &\\\\\n",
    "        \\displaystyle            & x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^p \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-p}\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the element-wise cost vector and $Ax \\le b$ is a set of constraints that define the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If all variables are integral ($p=n$), such problems are called **Integer Programs (IPs)**, or **Binary Programs (BPs)** in the case of binary variables $(x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear Programs (LPs) are \"nice\" because the feasible region $P(A,b) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid Ax \\le b\\}$ is a **convex polyhedron**. \\\n",
    "Convexity enables efficient algorithms (simplex, interior point, ellipsoid).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with integrality, the feasible set becomes $P(A,b) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^n$ which is **not convex** (it is a set of isolated lattice points).\n",
    "\n",
    "A central geometric object is the **integer hull** $\\operatorname{conv}\\bigl(P(A,b) \\cap \\mathbb{Z}^n\\bigr)$ (more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of modern integer optimization as combining two ideas:\n",
    "* **Relaxation**: Solve something convex first (typically the LP relaxation)\n",
    "* **Refinement**: Tighten the relaxation (cuts) and/or split the problem (branch-and-bound) until the solution is integral.\n",
